This is a silly "project" I made, after watching some of the sorting methods
on the CS50 week 3 lectures.

The program takes a single command line argument for the number of elements
to add random numbers to.

If no command line is added, it defaults to 10 numbers. 

There is currently one function (Sleep()), that requires Windows, but can easily
be changed to UNIX instead.

By default, random numbers are between 1 and 99 and print formatted accordingly.
